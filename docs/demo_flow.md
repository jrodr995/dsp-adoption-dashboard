## Demo Flow (2–3 minutes)

1) Executive table: Region → Division → Community. Call out Active Communities, % with DSP PVs, Total PVs, Ready Inventory.
2) Trendlines: % Communities with DSP PVs by Region over last 30 days. Explain relative-date filtering.
3) Last DSP Usage bars: bucket definitions and colors; discuss outreach prioritization.
4) Community bar list: PVs with % of total and inventory annotation.

Talking points
- Active-days backbone prevents counting inactive periods
- Weekly inventory snapshot joined as current context
- Relative-date responsive buckets using MAX(Event Date) from filtered range
